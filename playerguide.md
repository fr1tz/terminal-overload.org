# <a name="tutorials"></a> Tutorials
There are no tutorials yet.  
If you are as mad about that as we are, [get in touch with us](/community) or get your [hands dirty](/contribute) right away.

# <a name="playeralert"></a> Player Alert
The [Online Server Browser](http://aims.wasted.ch/tolservers) can alert you when people are playing.

# <a name="playsessions"></a> Play Sessions
Currently play sessions are organized in our Forum.  
Any [poll with at least 4 potential players](http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=89) will be added to the [MOTD](http://terminal-overload.org/motd).

# <a name="runyourserver"></a> Run a Server
Running a game server would provide an essential service to the player community. However there is no [Server Admin Guide](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/wiki/Server-Admin-Guide) yet. Get [in touch with us](/community) to get directions. If you succeed, don't hesitate to write add your experience to the [wiki](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/wiki/Server-Admin-Guide).
