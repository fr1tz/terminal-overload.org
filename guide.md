# <a name="tutorials"></a> Tutorials
Can you imagine? There are no tutorials yet.  
If you are as mad about that as we are, [get in touch with us](/community) or get your [hands dirty](/joindev) right away.

# <a name="findplayers"></a> Finding Players
* The [Online Server Browser](/serverbrowser) plays a sound when players are playing. 
* Join or organize scheduled [Play Sessions](/playsessions).
* Use the [Chat](/community#chat) to organize a spontaneous play session.

# <a name="registernick"></a>Register Your Player Name (optional)
Right now the only advantages to registering your player name
are avoiding being impersonated and getting rid of the "[P]" in front
of the name of unauthenticated players. But in future versions registered players
will have access to neat (purely cosmetic) customization options.

Registering a player name <b>costs $5</b> and supports [fr1tz](https://github.com/fr1tz)
, who is TOL's [main developer](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/graphs/contributors)
and also runs and administers the player database.
