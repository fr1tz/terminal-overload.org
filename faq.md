#What makes Terminal Overload different from other FPS games?
Terminal Overload is a continuation of [Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet](http://ethernet.wasted.ch/). Some of the features that make ROTC: Ethernet unique are explained in the [video for the "Resurrect Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet As Open-Source Project" IndieGoGo campaign](http://youtu.be/SnRJbxadTO4?t=2m24s).


#Does Terminal Overload run on Mac OS X?
It might, but nobody knows for sure until someone with programming skills and access to an OSX system tries to build and run the game there. At the time of writing this (Sep. 7 2014), [fr1tz](https://github.com/fr1tz) is still the only one doing programming work on the game and he does not have access to an OSX system.


#What licenses does Terminal Overload use?
Terminal Overload uses the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) for code and [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) for art.


#What game engine does Terminal Overload use?
Terminal Overload is built using [GarageGames](http://garagegames.com/)' MIT-licensed [Torque3D](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D) engine.


#What programming languages does Terminal Overload use?
The engine is written in C++ and supports a scripting language called TorqueScript, which is used to implement the bulk of the actual game.


#Why can't you open-source Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet?
ROTC: Ethernet was built using the Torque Game Engine (not to be confused with Torque3D). In order for ROTC: Ethernet to be open-sourced, TGE would have to be open-sourced first, which is hard for its developers to do, because TGE contains proprietary code licensed from other 3rd party developers.
