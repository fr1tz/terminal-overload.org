# <a name="intro"></a> Intro
Unusual for an FPS game, Terminal Overload is developed using 
the ["Bazaar" model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) of 
open-source development, meaning there's no formal organization working on the 
project behind closed doors, just a bunch of people working together over the
Internet using public tools like the project's [Chat](/community#chat), 
[Forum](/community#forum) and [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/issues)
to communicate and coordinate work on the project.

# <a name="contact"></a> Making Contact
The first thing you should do is letting main developer 
[fr1tz](mailto:mg@wasted.ch) and the other people
working on the project know that you're interested in participating in
the project.

The chat is probably the best place to make first contact:
[Join the chat](http://terminal-overload.org/community#chat) and say "hey fr1tz, I would like to participate".
Keep in mind that the chat is an [IRC channel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)
(#terminal-overload on irc.freenode.net), 
meaning it can take hours until you get a response, so be prepared to stick around. 

# <a name="tasks"></a> Ways to Contribute
To get an idea of the many ways you can participate in the project, take a look
at TOL's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/issues).
Here are some example filters:

* [Tasks that don't require programming skills](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Anocode)
* [Documentation tasks](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adocumentation)
* [Bite-sized tasks](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abitesized)
* [Tasks that require using Blender](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ablender)
* [Tasks that require using TorqueScript](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atorquescript)
* [Tasks that require using c++](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ac%2B%2B)

Keep in mind that those issues don't cover everything that needs or could be done.
A great way to participate is finding issues that need to be addressed,
regardless of whether you're capable of working on them yourself.
