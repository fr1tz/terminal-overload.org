# <a name="spreadtheword"></a> Spread the Word

If you're a member of the following social media sites, spreading the word about the project doesn't take much time but helps a lot:

* If you're on Twitter: Tweet
* If you're on Google+:
* If you're on Facebook:

Other places to spread the word are gaming forums (including gaming subreddits) where you're actively participating. Making a post about the game in such a place takes up more of your time, but has a higher chance of reaching people who might enjoy the game.
