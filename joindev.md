Unusual for an FPS game, Terminal Overload is developed using 
the ["Bazaar" model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) of 
open-source development, meaning there's no formal organization working on the 
project behind closed doors, just a bunch of people working together over the
Internet in view of the public.

So since there's no rigid formal process used to develop Terminal Overload,
it boils down to this: Releases are made from the contents of
[fr1tz' terminal-overload git repository on GitHub](https://github.com/fr1tz/terminal-overload).
So any additions, deletions or changes you want to make to the game have to find their
way into that repository. The prefered way of doing that is by sending a 
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) 
to [fr1tz](https://github.com/fr1tz). So if you don't know how to work using 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) and don't want to [learn it](https://help.github.com/),
you'll have to work with someone who does.

That aside, the first thing you should do is get into contact with fr1tz and the other people
working on the project. There are two places where TOL developers communicate:
The [Chat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=terminal-overload) and the
[Forum](http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=87).
The chat is probably the better place to make first contact: Just join the chat
and say something like "hey fr1tz, I'd be interested in joining development" and
go from there.
Keep in mind that the chat is an IRC channel (#terminal-overload on irc.freenode.net), 
meaning it can take hours until you get a response, so be prepared to stick around.
